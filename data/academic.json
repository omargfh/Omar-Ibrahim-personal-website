   alt=\"Libya's Map\" style=\"width: 200px; float: right; margin: 0 15px 15px;\">\n<p>Libya, a mid-northern African nation, situated on the coasts of the Mediterranean, bordering Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, Chad and Niger, and known for being rich in oil, has been starring in its potential annihilation ever since the attempted successful murder\n    of its 69-year-old leader Muammar Gaddafi. The annihilation actions and events were described by the former U.S. President Barack Obama as \u201cthe worst mistake\u201d of his presidency.\n</p>\n<p>In the Thursday dawn of October twentieth, Muammar Gaddafi in a coat of his bodyguards, and his head of\u2014now unsubstantial\u2014army made their steps forward to the west after a two-month siege of the Libyan coastal city Sirte (7 on the map). Allegedly, France\n    proclaimed strafing Libyan military vehicles near Sirte, without being sure-footed of the success of Gaddafi\u2019s assassination. Gaddafi, still coated in his henchmen, escaped the attack into two drainage pipes on the main road. In their escape, fighters\n    of the government patrol started firing; in turn, Gaddafi got heavily wounded in the head by one of his own men\u2019s gunshot before being captured. Governors were not sure of the accurate death time; however, it is estimated to be at the noon of the\n    same day.\n</p>\n<p>Prior to Gaddafi\u2019s death, the first civil war\u2014habitually referred to as 17 February Revolution\u2014broke out between the Libyan Armed Force, and the National Transitional Council (alongside the NATO members) after preceding protests and minor clashes to overthrow\n    Gaddafi\u2019s tyrant government. Originally, the population rage rose focused on local national affairs; over the time, it became further concerned with the deposing of Gaddafi\u2019s regime that turned into mutual firing between the NATO and the Libyan Armed\n    Force.\n</p>\n<p>During the military firing on the population, the UN Security Control froze all assets of Ghaddafi, thereby restricting his travels and criminalizing his actions, and later on, attacking his powers and enforcing no-fly areas over the nation. Libyan territories\n    authority was, by force, taken back and forth between the two parties. In the aftermath of Gaddafi\u2019s death, the National Transition Council was considered the Libyan contemporary leading power after their recognition from the UN, declaring the end\n    of the war.\n</p>\n<p>The incidents of the Libyan regicide of Muammar Gaddafi brought undesirable bifurcation to the national population of Libya, the proliferation of weapons, lawlessness, and wide massacres. The Libyan people\u2019s desire for a democratically endorsed nation\n    died out in the increasing vaccines of crimes, and the inevitable military craves for the Libyan oil. Most of the nation became under the sovereignty of Tobruk-led government (Tobruk, 12 on the map) powered by the House of Representatives and the\n    Libyan National Army. Having some north- and- southwestern land under the control of the Government of National Accord, a land in the north overtaken by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and distinct, scattered areas under the power of local forces.\n    In addition, a group of armed extremists known as the Shoura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries emblazoned its name in the conflicts after repeated attacks on Libyan military bases.\n</p>\n<p>Ongoing conflicts ameliorated in 2014 after an unsuccessful military coup established by the Libyan Republican Alliance into a second civil war. The war was waged between the Libyan House of Representatives, Government of National Accord, National Salvation\n    Government, The Shoura Council, and ISIS, with both Egypt and the UAE involved.\n</p>\n<p>Breaking out in Friday sixteenth, 2014, the battle of Benghazi took place, in which field marshal Khalifa Haftar, head of the Libyan National Army attacked Islamist paramilitaries in Benghazi (8 on the map), with the intention of their total eradication.\n    The reciprocal ammunition discharge (between the Shoura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries and ISIS against the Libyan Armed Forced) killed and injured hundreds of extremist, army force, and innocent individuals.\n</p>\n<p>In August of the same year, the two parties relapsed the missiles shooting after an attempt from the Shoura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries (SCBR) to take over the Benina Airport. Nonetheless, the continuous attempts to fulfill the offense failed\n    and leading back into the second Battle of Benghazi.\n</p>\n<p>Unlike the first quarrel, the second Battle of Benghazi continued for 3 years, starting in October 2014 between SCBR (partnering with Libya Shield and Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room), ISIS, and the Libyan Armed Force. The affairs of the battle\n    exploited the action of the Benina Airport offense to deploy the Libyan National Army deep into the den of Benghazi \u201cterrorists\u201d, according to Haftar. Haftar moved his forces into Benghazi in October 2014, with the support of Benghazi residents dismantling\n    Islamist checkpoints.\n</p>\n<p>LNA or Libyan National Army proclaimed their authority over 90% of the city by December of the same year. Two months later, the LNA got involved in heavy clashes and almost 700 death. The firing continued at uneven paces between the aforementioned parties\n    until the LNA succeeded in purging out the terrorists of Benghazi. Few battles continued to exist in 2018, having the Battle of Sabha as the last one so far. The war remains active until now, enforcing disorder, broad catastrophes, and a death toll\n    of almost 4,000 human being.\n</p>", "side": "<p class=\"no-indent\">* picture by Setav</p><p class=\"no-indent\">Libya is a mediterranean country located to the west of Egypt and south of Italy.

Be sure that your analysis focuses on the most relevant features of the passage.</b>>br><b>Your essay should not explain whether you agree with Braun\u2019s claims, but rather explain how Braun builds an argument to persuade his audience.</b></p></p><p>The idea that the US government must continue to invest in NASA is indispensably entrenched in American economics, but its cardinal causes are often overlooked, In \"Space Technology: A Critical Investment for Our Nation's Future,\" Bobby Braun synthesizes a dissertation that America should pursue funding and expansion opportunities for NASA to accomplish its intended missions. Although many detractors believe that NASA has already emblazoned itself as the bellwether of space exploration and is no need for continuous investments at this point, arguments put forth in this article dismiss such romantic critics as excessively dogmatic in their provincial ideology. In doing so, Braun employs a diverse set of supporting evidence including examples, word choice, and juxtaposition.</p><p>Braun deft use of supporting examples begins in paragraph 2 as he mentions a variety of \"cutting-edge technology\" that includes \"the Apollo mission,\" \"the space shuttle,\" \"the International Space Station,\" and others. In implementing these examples into his editorial, Braun is capable of instilling the idea that NASA has provided various infamous milestones in the past, which he later contrasts with \"NASA's technology base is largely depleted\" in paragraph 3. That way, Braun is capable of not only laying down an introduction that grips the reader into comprehending the wide impact of NASA but also allows his contention to trail down a path that eventually lead the reader into an understanding of why funding is important for a continuous success for NASA and America's competitive economy. Later, in paragraph 4, Braun shows another set of examples as he begins to detail NASA's \"exciting new chapter in human space exploration.\" This comes in direct juxtaposition with the earlier examples to show that NASA's future is distinctively similar to its past. Readers, especially skeptic detractors, are caught in the idea that funding space would no longer be profitable or that new innovations in space exploration are not possible. These examples that include \"full use of the International Space Station,\" \"development of a crew vehicle,\" and more in the same sentence ground the author's argument in reality that even the most doubtful readers would not be able to dismiss the need for monetary governmental support for NASA.</p><p>Just as persuasive as Braun's use of supporting examples is his choice of words. His meticulous diction of intense words is vividly displayed in words such as \"strong\" (paragraph 1 in description of Aerospace's fundamental importance to American trade balance), \"cutting-edge\" (paragraph 2 in narration of various examples of past achievements of NASA, and \"chronic\" (paragraph 3 in stating dangers faced by modern-day NASA.\" The first two words evoke an imagery of strength and power that the reader relates to NASA, creating an overall good connotation to make the author's argument easier to accept, while the third serves the purpose of using this image and contrasting it with weaknesses that NASA might suffer. Ultimately, the use of the three words allow the author to make the reader relate to NASA, not as a national agency, but as a person who can be \"strong\" and suffer weakness due to \"chronic\" actions to further push their support of the importance of NASA's investment for American trade. Braun also employs another set of words: \"pioneering spirit,\" \"embodied\" (paragraph 3 in contrasting past NASA with modern-day NASA), and \"mature\" (paragraph 5). The use of words typically employed in description of human person greatly adds to Braun's persuasive power as he is not implying that NASA could be seen as a human being (like in earlier examples of word choice) but directly stating it. Readers are generally more capable of identifying with another human being over a non-living national cluster which makes Braun's argument change from objective economic needs of the nation to an exploitation of human empathy.</p><p>Lastly, Braun bolsters his argument with juxtaposition. He mentions that \"Nearly 50 years ago, a young president gave NASA a grand challenge\u2014one chose...for its audacity,\" and he later follow, \"NASA can do the same today.\" The complex nature of the author's juxtaposition in which he creates a hypothetical situation to compare with a state of glamour that NASA lived in the past lays the ground for the reader to imagine what Braun has in mind and the reasons behind his support for the NASA's funding. The reader would affirm that NASA's leadership is not \"granted,\" and that further work and national fund is needed to keep the legacy going. \"This is the task for which this agency is built...

In most of these games, non-player characters are used to simulate people in cities. It does not seem surprising, considering how most computers nowadays carry out nearly 2-4 billion calculations per second. In the same sense NPCs are used to populate videogames, computers can help simulate populations in pandemics in order to take calculated decisions (Lankoski, P and Bjork, S 2007)</span>\n        <sup>[1]</sup><span>.</span></p>\n\n    <p><span>To give an idea of how that could be established, consider first how computer programming works: essentially, a program takes input data (for simplicity\u2019s sake, assume everything is a number) and performs numerical manipulations based on rules defined through code. A code, similarily, is a set of precise orders that exploit tools offered by programming languages, such as controlled repetition and making decisions (Halterman, R 1995)</span>\n        <sup>[2]</sup><span>.</span></p>\n\n    <p><span>In a pandemic, populations could be interperted a list of </span><span>variables</span><span>&nbsp;(tracked data with changing values) that traverses a coordinate system. Each variable represents an individual that abides by the SIR model, which means it is either \u201csusceptible,\u201d \u201cinfectious,\u201d or \u201cremoved.\u201d In a programming environment, it is possible to define the size of the coordinate system, the size of the population, and the rules that define the change from S-&gt;R. For instance, each variable may only infect 20% of other individuals within a defined range-of-infection. Once our program runs, it generates function </span>\n        <span>S(t)</span><span>, susceptible people as a function of time, which can be represented graphically.</span></p>\n\n    <p><span>Now, a typical epidemiologist would like to introduce approaches to limit the growth of an epidemic. However, computers only deal with numbers, so it is impossible to tell a computer to \u201c</span><span>introduce face masks,</span>\n        <span>\u201d for instance. That is why an epidemiologist has to cast real-life ideas into a numerical representation. To execute the face mask example, an epidemiologist might cut down the probability of infection to 1.5%, assuming all population abides\n            (</span><span>Magal, P. and Webb, G 2018)</span><sup>[3]</sup><span>.</span></p>\n\n    <p><span>To translate this into a decision-making model, it is necessary to definite the function </span><span>S(t) </span><span>more formally to be equivalent of </span><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\"\n            style=\"transform: translateY(20%);\" alt=\"Equation\"><span>, where the number of susceptible individuals at any unit time is proportional to the basic reproduction number </span>\n        <span>R</span><span>0</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(Smith, D. and Moore, L. 2004)</span><sup>[4]</sup><span>. </span><span>As the epidemiologist experiments with different pandemic scenarios, this value is generated and allows for comparison between different approaches or even a concatenation of many, where a lower value means less spread and a better decision.</span></p>\n    <p><span></span></p>\n    <p><span>Nonetheless, this model is not perfect.
