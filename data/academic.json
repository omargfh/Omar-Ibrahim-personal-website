Be sure that your analysis focuses on the most relevant features of the passage.</b></p><p><b>Your essay should not explain whether you agree with Braun\u2019s claims, but rather explain how Braun builds an argument to persuade his audience.</b></p><p>The idea that the US government must continue to invest in NASA is indispensably entrenched in American economics, but its cardinal causes are often overlooked, In \"Space Technology: A Critical Investment for Our Nation's Future,\" Bobby Braun synthesizes a dissertation that America should pursue funding and expansion opportunities for NASA to accomplish its intended missions. Although many detractors believe that NASA has already emblazoned itself as the bellwether of space exploration and is no need for continuous investments at this point, arguments put forth in this article dismiss such romantic critics as excessively dogmatic in their provincial ideology. In doing so, Braun employs a diverse set of supporting evidence including examples, word choice, and juxtaposition.</p><p>Braun deft use of supporting examples begins in paragraph 2 as he mentions a variety of \"cutting-edge technology\" that includes \"the Apollo mission,\" \"the space shuttle,\" \"the International Space Station,\" and others. In implementing these examples into his editorial, Braun is capable of instilling the idea that NASA has provided various infamous milestones in the past, which he later contrasts with \"NASA's technology base is largely depleted\" in paragraph 3. That way, Braun is capable of not only laying down an introduction that grips the reader into comprehending the wide impact of NASA but also allows his contention to trail down a path that eventually lead the reader into an understanding of why funding is important for a continuous success for NASA and America's competitive economy. Later, in paragraph 4, Braun shows another set of examples as he begins to detail NASA's \"exciting new chapter in human space exploration.\" This comes in direct juxtaposition with the earlier examples to show that NASA's future is distinctively similar to its past. Readers, especially skeptic detractors, are caught in the idea that funding space would no longer be profitable or that new innovations in space exploration are not possible. These examples that include \"full use of the International Space Station,\" \"development of a crew vehicle,\" and more in the same sentence ground the author's argument in reality that even the most doubtful readers would not be able to dismiss the need for monetary governmental support for NASA.</p><p>Just as persuasive as Braun's use of supporting examples is his choice of words. His meticulous diction of intense words is vividly displayed in words such as \"strong\" (paragraph 1 in description of Aerospace's fundamental importance to American trade balance), \"cutting-edge\" (paragraph 2 in narration of various examples of past achievements of NASA, and \"chronic\" (paragraph 3 in stating dangers faced by modern-day NASA.\" The first two words evoke an imagery of strength and power that the reader relates to NASA, creating an overall good connotation to make the author's argument easier to accept, while the third serves the purpose of using this image and contrasting it with weaknesses that NASA might suffer. Ultimately, the use of the three words allow the author to make the reader relate to NASA, not as a national agency, but as a person who can be \"strong\" and suffer weakness due to \"chronic\" actions to further push their support of the importance of NASA's investment for American trade. Braun also employs another set of words: \"pioneering spirit,\" \"embodied\" (paragraph 3 in contrasting past NASA with modern-day NASA), and \"mature\" (paragraph 5). The use of words typically employed in description of human person greatly adds to Braun's persuasive power as he is not implying that NASA could be seen as a human being (like in earlier examples of word choice) but directly stating it. Readers are generally more capable of identifying with another human being over a non-living national cluster which makes Braun's argument change from objective economic needs of the nation to an exploitation of human empathy.</p><p>Lastly, Braun bolsters his argument with juxtaposition. He mentions that \"Nearly 50 years ago, a young president gave NASA a grand challenge\u2014one chose...for its audacity,\" and he later follow, \"NASA can do the same today.\" The complex nature of the author's juxtaposition in which he creates a hypothetical situation to compare with a state of glamour that NASA lived in the past lays the ground for the reader to imagine what Braun has in mind and the reasons behind his support for the NASA's funding. The reader would affirm that NASA's leadership is not \"granted,\" and that further work and national fund is needed to keep the legacy going. \"This is the task for which this agency is built... America expects no less,\" he concludes his juxtaposition, stressing that such a probable situation is the sole purpose of the agency, further eliciting the image in the reader's mind. </p><p>In summary, author Bobby Braun\u2014using supporting examples, word choice, and juxtaposition\u2014makes the case that the US government should dedicate further spending portions of its investments for NASA. It is these persuasive elements that not only informs the reader about a situation but spurs the reader into making it a reality.</p>", "side": null, "desc": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In most of these games, non-player characters are used to simulate people in cities. It does not seem surprising, considering how most computers nowadays carry out nearly 2-4 billion calculations per second. In the same sense NPCs are used to populate videogames, computers can help simulate populations in pandemics in order to take calculated decisions (Lankoski, P and Bjork, S 2007)</span>\n        <sup><a href=\"#ftnt1\" id=\"ftnt_ref1\">[1]</a></sup><span>.</span></p>\n\n    <p><span>To give an idea of how that could be established, consider first how computer programming works: essentially, a program takes input data (for simplicity\u2019s sake, assume everything is a number) and performs numerical manipulations based on rules defined through code. A code, similarily, is a set of precise orders that exploit tools offered by programming languages, such as controlled repetition and making decisions (Halterman, R 1995)</span>\n        <sup><a href=\"#ftnt2\" id=\"ftnt_ref2\">[2]</a></sup><span>.</span></p>\n\n    <p><span>In a pandemic, populations could be interperted a list of </span><span>variables</span><span>&nbsp;(tracked data with changing values) that traverses a coordinate system. Each variable represents an individual that abides by the SIR model, which means it is either \u201csusceptible,\u201d \u201cinfectious,\u201d or \u201cremoved.\u201d In a programming environment, it is possible to define the size of the coordinate system, the size of the population, and the rules that define the change from S-&gt;R. For instance, each variable may only infect 20% of other individuals within a defined range-of-infection. Once our program runs, it generates function </span>\n        <span>S(t)</span><span>, susceptible people as a function of time, which can be represented graphically.</span></p>\n\n    <p><span>Now, a typical epidemiologist would like to introduce approaches to limit the growth of an epidemic. However, computers only deal with numbers, so it is impossible to tell a computer to \u201c</span><span>introduce face masks,</span>\n        <span>\u201d for instance. That is why an epidemiologist has to cast real-life ideas into a numerical representation.
